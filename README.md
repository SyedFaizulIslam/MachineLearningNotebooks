# MachineLearningNotebooks
This repository contains content that I share in my workshops with softare developers who are interested in getting started with Machine Learning.

Beside creating Machine Learning jupyter notebooks this repo also contains deplyment code the machine learning model files using flask api.

app.py: This file shows an example of loading machine learning model .pkl file as a REST api

app_tensorflowmodel.py: This file shows an example of tensorflow/keras model as a REST api. User may need to tweak some lines of code like providing the correct model file name and as well code for preparing the independent values.
